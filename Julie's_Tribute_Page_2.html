        <p>As we begin our journey, it is helpful to get a quick overview of the <strong>questions</strong> we will try to answer.
        </p>
        <h2>Our list of questions about philosophy</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>What is a philosophy?</li>
            <li>What are the branches of philosophy?</li>
            <li>What is a paradigm?</li>
            <li>What are the different paradigms associated with education?</li>
            <li>What are the different paradigms associated with psychology?</li>
            <li>What is a learning theory and how does it fit into philosophy?</li>
            <li>What is a conceptual framework?</li>
            <li>What does a teaching philosophy look like?</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
        <p>In addition, when we are greeted with ten paradigms most suited for inquiry in the world of teaching, we will target particular topics and questions so we can then <em>compare and contrast</em> each paradigm. This close study will be beneficial as we move forward and begin writing our teaching philosophy </p>
       <ol>
            <li>What are some paradigms in education while others are in psychology?</li>
            <li>If I had to capture a big idea to represent each paradigm what would they be</li>
            <li>What content is central in each paradigm and who decides what it studied?</li>
            <li>What is the expected role of a teacher?</li>
            <li>What is the expected role of the learner?</li>
            <li>What learning environment is supported by this paradigm?</li>
            <li>How does this paradigm view learning in the brain?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>How are the views of education paradigms similar to those from psychology?</li>
                <li>How are the views of education paradigms different from psychology?</li>
            </ul>
            <li>What learning theories/theorists seem to reside within each paradigm?</li>
            <li>How do I decide how to align my own belief system?</li>
